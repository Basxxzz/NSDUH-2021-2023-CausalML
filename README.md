# 1. Overview 

This repository contains the full reproducible pipeline for my ongoing research project:

> **Reliable and Fair Causal Machine Learning for Sparse Subpopulations in Survey Data:
> Substance Use and Major Depressive Episode among Reproductive-Age Women
> (NSDUH 2021–2023)**

This project is the core research component of my PhD applications (CS / Data Science / AI / Biostatistics/ Computaional Social Science).

It is designed to demonstrate: 
- my ability to build **end-to-end causal machine learning pipelines**,
- perform **survey-design–aware inference**,
- conduct **heterogeneous treatment effect** estimation,
- evaluate **fairness across subgroups**, and
- maintain **reproducible scientific workflows**.

This repository is designed to be fully reproducible and modular, enabling independent validation of each component (data processing, weighted GLM, DML ATE, Causal Forest CATE, and fairness diagnostics).

# 2. Research Motivation

Major Depressive Episode (MDE) remains a significant public-health burden among U.S. women of reproductive age. 

Traditional regression methods struggle with:
- sparse exposure patterns（e.g., stimulant misuse）
- heterogeneous effects（pregnancy, income, race）
- fairness and subgroup disparity
- survey weights and complex sampling design

This project uses **survey-weighted causal inference + modern causal ML** to study the relationship between substance use and MDE.

# 3. Data

**Dataset:** National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), 2021–2023 public-use files
**Population:** Women aged **18–49**, including pregnant women 
**N** ≈ varies by year, pooled as harmonized dataset 

### **Outcome** 
- **IRAMDEYR** — Past-year Major Depressive Episode (binary)

### **Exposures** 
- **ILLYR** — Any illicit drug use (past year)
- **PNRNMYR** — Pain-reliever misuse (past year)
- **STMNMYR** — Stimulant misuse (past year)
- **ANY_CANNA_EVER** — Lifetime cannabis use (derived from MJEVER, CBDHMPEVR)

### **Covariates** 
- AGE3, NEWRACE2, IRMARIT, EDUHIGHCAT, INCOME
- IRINSUR4, ANY_NIC_EVER, ALCMON
- IRPREG, YEAR (2021/2022/2023)

### **Survey Weights** 
- ANALWT2_C1 / C2 / C3 (divided by 3 for pooled analysis)

# 4. Methods Pipeline (A + B + C + D) 

This repository follows a four-stage causal ML pipeline. 
The pipeline is structured as A (Weighted GLM) + B (DML for ATE) + C (Causal Forest for CATE) + D (Fairness Diagnostics).

--- 

## **A. Baseline: Weighted GLM (Logit)** 
- Survey-weighted logistic regression
- Construct a pooled weight `W_NORM` from ANALWT2_C1/C2/C3 (dividing by 3 and re-normalizing to mean 1)  
- Exposure → MDE(Major Depressive Episode) with full controls
- Robust SEs, domain corrections
- Produces baseline ATE and adjusted predicted probabilities

---

## **B. Double Machine Learning (ATE)** 
- Orthogonal DML
- Flexible nuisance learners (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, regularized GLM)
- Cross-fitting to avoid overfitting
- ATE estimate for per exposure

---

## **C. Causal Forest (CATE)** 
- Generalized Random Forest
- Subgroup heterogeneity by IRPREG, income, race
- Variable importance, partial dependence
- Outputs: CATE distribution, Variable importance, Partial dependence functions, Heterogeneity heatmaps

---

## **D. Fairness Diagnostics** 
- TPR/FPR/PPV by pregnancy, race, income
- Fairness disparity plots
- Compare predictive disparity vs causal heterogeneity
- Identify whether ML models amplify or reduce subgroup inequality
